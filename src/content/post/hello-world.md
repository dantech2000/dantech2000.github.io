# Hello World!

Welcome to DevOps Dan! I'm excited to launch this space where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and insights about DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and site reliability engineering.

## About Me

I'm a DevOps Engineer with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry. I'm passionate about building reliable systems, automating everything, and sharing knowledge with the community.

## This Blog's Tech Stack

This blog is built with some fantastic modern technologies:
